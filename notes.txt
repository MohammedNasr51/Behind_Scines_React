performance:

    understanding the component tree when rendering make you know how to make the 
    performance good.

    if you have a components in the app component that not necesserly should reexecutes
    if the app rerendered and it is in the high level of the tree so =>

1 - memo solution :
        you can rapp the component in the memo that you will import from react and store 
        the value in a const and export default it 
    - what memo does ?
        it checks the props that comming when the parent is rerendering if it changed it 
        makes the component rerendered and if not it prevents the unneccessary rerendering.

    - when you should use it ?
        the answer is in the line 6.

    - you should be aware of the ability of make a seperate component that causes the change
        and left some state and this will solve the proplem initially (be clever).
